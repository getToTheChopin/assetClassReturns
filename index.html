    <h1>Historical Investment Returns by Asset Class</h1>

    &nbsp;

    <p>This resource shows historical investment returns for a broad set of investment "asset classes" -- stocks, bonds, and beyond.</p>
    <p>We'll dig into questions such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What were the best (and worst) investments of 2020?</li>
        <li>Is any asset class consistently outperforming the rest?</li>
        <li>How do different asset classes compare in terms of long-term averages, minimum / maximum returns, and volatility?</li>
        <li>What is the correlation level between assets? Do bonds perform well when stocks go down (and vice versa)?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This analysis is all about understanding how different investments have performed in the past, so that you can chart out an informed path ahead.</p>
    <p>Armed with a good sense of how your investments might perform in the future, you can think through major financial plans or decisions -- whether that's <a href="https://themeasureofaplan.com/rent-versus-buy-calculator/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">renting versus buying your home</a>, <a href="https://themeasureofaplan.com/retirement-date-forecasting-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecasting your retirement age</a>, or just getting a general grip on <a href="https://themeasureofaplan.com/net-worth-scenario-tool/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">where your financial trajectory is headed</a>.</p>

    <h2>A Universe of Investment Options</h2>
    <p>For those who've searched for historical investment returns, you've likely come across data based on the S&P 500 -- an index that tracks the performance of the 500 largest publicly-traded companies in the U.S.</p>
    <p>While the S&P 500 index covers the companies that feature prominently in American business news (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, JP Morgan, and the like), there's a whole wide world out there that isn't being covered.</p>
    <p>If you wanted to invest in technology companies in China, bonds in Europe, gold, or real estate, you won't find those options in the S&P 500.</p>
    <p>Broadly speaking, the 'universe' of investment options can be broken down by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Underlying asset type -- whether that's stocks, bonds, or other assets such as real estate, commodities, etc.</li>
        <li>Country -- developed countries (such as the U.S., Canada, Germany) versus emerging markets (such as China, India, Brazil)</li>
        <li>Risk level -- stocks of large mature companies versus small high-growth firms, government bonds versus high-yield / high-risk corporate bonds</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Paul Simon sang about the <em>"50 ways to leave your lover"</em>, but surely he forgot about the 100+ ways to build a portfolio...</p>

    <p>For this analysis, we'll stretch ourselves beyond the S&P 500, and take into account the asset classes below.</p>

    <p>For each of the 12 asset classes, we'll be working with the annual returns from 1985 to 2020 -- a total period of 36 years. Note that all returns in this analysis are the "real total return" values -- meaning that they are adjusted to take into account inflation, and the re-investment of dividends.</p>

    <img src="https://themeasureofaplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Asset-Class-Raw-Returns-v2.png">

    <p>There's quite a bit of data to process, and showing the raw numbers in a table isn't super helpful for digesting the information.</p>

    <p>So without further ado, let's get started on slicing, dicing, and prettying up the data.</p>

    &nbsp;

    <h2>Periodic Table of Investment Returns by Asset Class</h2>

    <p>The table below shows the annual performance of each asset class. For each year, the values are shown in ranked order -- the best performer appears at the top of the table, and the worst performer is at the bottom.</p>

    <p>Hover your mouse over the cells in the table to highlight the returns of a single asset class. Scroll left to see data going back until 1985.</p>

    <div id="periodicTableDiv">

    </div>

    <p id="periodicTableNotes">Note: The average in the last column is based on the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for each asset class across all years. 2020 metrics are year-to-date (YTD) as of Oct. 31, 2020, assuming an inflation rate of 1.2% in 2020.</p>

    &nbsp;

    <p>It's no easy feat to pick the winner in a given year. The asset class rankings appear to be randomly tossed about over time, with the top performer in one year often falling down to the middle or bottom of the table in the next year.</p>

    &nbsp;

    <p>Now the same data is presented, but in a more traditional line chart format. While the periodic table format above does a good job of showing the ranked order (which asset class was first, second, third...), the chart below helps us to visualize the gap between different asset classes (how much better the first asset was compared to the second).</p>
    <p>Click the asset class labels in the legend below to toggle them on/off from displaying in the chart.</p>

    <h2>Year in Focus</h2>

    <p>Use the drop-down menu below to zoom in on a single year. The investment returns for each asset class in that year will be shown.</p>
    <p>This allows us to focus on specific events in market history -- such as the great financial crisis of 2008, when stocks plunged by 30-50%, while bonds and gold actually recorded slight gains.</p>

    <h2>Single Asset Class Deep Dive</h2>

    <p>Use the drop-down menu below to focus on one asset class at a time.</p>
    <p>The bottom chart in this section shows the range of returns using short, medium, and long-term time horizons. The potental range of outcomes is very wide when you look at returns over only 1 year, but the range narrows and becomes more predictable as the time horizon gets longer.</p>

    <h2>Correlations Between Asset Class Investment Returns</h2>

    <p>The chart below shows the correlation level between each pair of asset classes.</p>
    <p>The values shown are correlation coefficients (Pearson's R values) that measure the strength of the relationship between each pair of asset classes. A value of 1 indicates a strong positive relationship; a value of -1 indicates a strong negative relationship; a value of 0 indicates no relationship between the two asset clsses.</p>
    <p>A few takeaways here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All categories of stocks have fairly high correlation with each other (values close to 1)</li>
        <li>Bonds have minimal correlation with stocks (values closer to 0)</li>
        <li>Gold has a slight negative correlation with some of the other assets</li>

    <h2>Final Thoughts, Notes & Sources</h2>

    <p>And that's a wrap.</p>

    <p>After sifting through a heap of data, my key takeaways are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's hard (perhaps impossible) to predict which asset class will be the best performer in the future. There doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to the annual rankings</li>
        <li>Investment returns are far more reliable if you have a long time horizon. The likelihood of losing money is much greater if you're investing over a 1-year period rather than a 5, 10, or 20-year period</li>
        <li>Diversification has clear benefits. Allocating a portion of your portfolio towards bonds will cushion your losses in years when stocks tumble.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All in all, it's my firm belief that the optimal investing strategy comes down a few simple steps -- <a href="https://themeasureofaplan.com/a-blueprint-for-building-wealth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">invest in a diversified passive portfolio</a>, stay invested in the long-term, and re-balance when necessary.</p>
